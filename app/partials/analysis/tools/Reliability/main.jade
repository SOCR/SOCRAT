        Cronbach's α coefficient is a point estimate of the reliability.
        Its standard error is important to construct an interval estimation of its true value
        and to obtain statistical inference about its significance.
        There are parametric and non-parametric methods to estimate the variance of Cronbach's α,
        and compute confidence intervals.

        The Intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) assesses the consistency, or reproducibility,
        of quantitative measurements made by different observers measuring the same quantity.
        Broadly speaking, the ICC is defined as the ratio of between-cluster variance to total variance.

        In Split-Half Reliability assessment, the test is split in half (e.g., odd / even) creating "equivalent forms".
        The two "forms" are correlated with each other and the correlation coefficient is adjusted
        to reflect the entire test length, using the Spearman-Brown Prophecy formula.

        The Kuder–Richardson Formula 20 (KR-20) is a very reliable internal reliability estimate which simulates
        calculating split-half reliability for every possible combination of items.
        The Cronbach's α and KR-20 are similar ― KR-20 is a derivative of the Cronbach's α with the advantage that
        it can handle both dichotomous and continuous variables, however, KR-20 can't be used
        when multiple-choice questions involve partial credit and require systematic item-based analysis.
