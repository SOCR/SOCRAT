Installation
------------
In case you wish to create your own module or contribute to the project, follow these steps to setup your environment.

First, install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) if you haven't yet. `npm` is the package manager for `Node.js` and comes bundled with it.

Install Webpack:

    $> sudo npm install webpack -g

Clone the repository:

    $> git clone https://github.com/SOCR/SOCRAT.git
    $> cd SOCRAT
    
If you're interested in latest changes or want to contribute to the project, switch to the `dev` branch:

    $> git checkout dev
    $> git pull

Now, lets install all the dependencies:

    $> npm install

This will install all the dependencies mentioned in package.json files.

Start the development server and see the application running at `localhost:8080`:

    $> npm run serve
    
See how to [add test datasets](https://github.com/SOCR/SOCRAT/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTE.md#socr-datasets-for-testing) and general [contrubition instructions](https://github.com/SOCR/SOCRAT/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTE.md).

Motivation 
--------------
[SOCR](http://socr.umich.edu), Statistics Online Computational Resource has a huge user base who constantly access the educational data present and java tools which use these data to aid in understanding statistics.
As far as the technology is concerned, currently all the applications are written in `java` and are presented as java applets. The reach of these applications is bottlenecked by technology.

Goal
------
The world is going the HTML5 way. Browsers are becoming more powerful. 
We intend to create a toolbox which will serve users on all platforms. We are primarily using `CoffeeScript` (compiles to `JavaScript`) for all the computations and presentation. Given the fact that todayâ€™s browsers have powerful javaScript engines (`v8`, `SpiderMonkey`), we perform all the calculations on the browser with no server dependency. File management, database, computation will be performed inside the browser.
