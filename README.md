Installation
------------
In case you wish to run SOCRAT locally, or create your own module, or contribute
to the project, follow these steps to setup your environment.

First, install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) if you haven't yet. `npm` is the package manager for `Node.js` and comes bundled with it.

Install Webpack:

    $> sudo npm install webpack -g

Clone the repository:

    $> git clone https://github.com/SOCR/SOCRAT.git
    $> cd SOCRAT

Switch to the `dev` branch to see latest changes or to contribute to the project:

    $> git checkout dev
    $> git pull

Now, install all the dependencies:

    $> npm install

After that build the project and start the web-server:

    $> npm run build
    $> node server.js

Now you shoule be able to access SOCRAT at `localhost:3000`.

Start the development server with:

    $> npm run serve

You will see the application running at `localhost:8080` and the page will live
reload on saved changes in source code.
Also see how to [add test datasets](https://github.com/SOCR/SOCRAT/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTE.md#socr-datasets-for-testing) and general [contrubition instructions](https://github.com/SOCR/SOCRAT/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTE.md).

Motivation
--------------
The modern web is a successful platform for large scale interactive web applications, including visualizations. Statistics Online Computational Resource ([SOCR](http://socr.umich.edu)) provides a
web-based collection of tools for interactive modeling and visual data analysis that has a large user base. However, most of SOCR applets eventually became practically unavailable to end users as new versions of browsers disabled Java by default as a response to numerous vulnerability reports.
Thus, we designed an open-source platform to build Statistics Online Computational Resource
Analytical Toolbox (SOCRAT). Platform design defines: (1) a specification for an architecture for building VA applications with multi-level modularity, and (2) methods for optimizing module
interaction, re-usage, and extension. SOCRAT relies on this platform for integration of a number of data management, analysis, and visualization modules into an easily customizable web application including interfaces for merging third-party components. This ability allows SOCRAT to balance expressive, interactive and processing capabilities, efficiency, compatibility, and accessibility. Multi-level modularity and declarative specifications enable easy customizations of the application, for instance, for a specific project. Online demo demonstrates how SOCRAT can be used for data input, display, and storage, with interactive visualization and analysis.
