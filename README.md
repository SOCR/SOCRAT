* Issue-tracking and project management: https://socredu.atlassian.net/browse/SOCRFW

Motivation 
--------------
[SOCR](http://socr.ucla.edu), Statistics Online Computational Resource has a huge user base who constantly access the educational data present and java tools which use these data to aid in understanding statistics.
As far as the technology is concerned, currently all the applications are written in `java` and are presented as java applets. The reach of these applications is bottlenecked by technology.

Goal
------
The world is going the HTML5 way. Browsers are becoming more powerful. 
We intend to create new framework which will serve users across all platforms. We will be primarily using `CoffeeScript` (compiles to `JavaScript`) for all the computations and presentation. Given the fact that today’s browsers have powerful javaScript engines (`v8`, `SpiderMonkey`), we will perform all the calculations on the browser with **no server dependency**. File management, database, computation will be performed inside the browser.
